# Where did it come from?
The data originally came from an exercise in a course I'd taken, but the data was handled with limited scope. I essentially used the same data to make my own project.

# What is it?
This data is on absenteeism, or number of hours and frequency of absences in a business. By cross referencing other data on the individuals absent, a business could reduce the amount of absenteeism. The goal of the project
is to uncover whatever those factors may be.
